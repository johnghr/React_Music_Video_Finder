# React_Music_video_Finder

This application was made using React.js for a personal project to consolidate my undertanding of React.js and API's. The user can input 
a musical artist and the app will return a list of similiar artists via a fetch request to an API. The user can then click on the listed
artists and another request is made to a different API which returns all of the selected artists music videos. In order for this app to run
you will require the following browser extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc .
Unfortunately, while using the above extension allows the search function to work, it also breaks the music video iframes as the extension is
not supported by Youtube.

In order to run this application please:

1. Fork this repository
2. Instal the above browser extension and activate it
3. Navigate to the Video_Finder app in your terminal
4. Navigate to client and run npm start
